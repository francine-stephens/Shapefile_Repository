## Shapefile Repository
The repository contains code for manipulating shapefiles and deriving special geographies for projects. The original shapefiles and other spatial object formats are not uploaded here due to capcacity limits. Shapefile paths are referenced in the code, so that the same directory can be replicated across scripts. If specific shapefiles are needed, please request by emailing [fis@stanford.edu](mailto:fis@stanford.edu).
