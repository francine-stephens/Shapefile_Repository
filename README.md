# Shapefile_Repository
The repository contains code for manipulating shapefiles and deriving geographies. The shapefiles and other spatial object formats are not uploaded here due to capcacity limits. 
Shapefile paths are referenced in the code, so that the same structure can be replicated. If shapefiles are needed, please request.
